          <li>Speed: If it doesn&apos;t load in under 2 seconds, you&apos;re losing customers.</li>
          <li>Clarity: It must pass the &quot;5-second test&quot;: visitors must know what you do instantly.</li>
          <li>Action: Every page needs a clear call-to-action guiding the user.</li>
          <li>Mobile-First: It must be flawless on a phone, where most users will see it.</li>
          <li>SEO-Ready: It must be built to be found on Google from day one.</li>

          <li>
            A Focus on ROI: The right partner talks less about colors and fonts and more about how they&apos;ll turn your website into a predictable source of
            revenue.
          </li>
